The goal of this project is to simulate a shopping mall using semaphores. first the customers arrive(simulated by sleep of random time) then we check if they have returns(n<4). if they do they first go to do the returns. they wait on line until a clerk is ready for them and then are checked out by the clerk. once done they start shopping for new items(sleep random time). when they are ready they get online to purchase the item. the checkout clerk checks to see if there is an open register and if there is will send the next available customer to check out. then the customer will wait in the food court for a random time and leave. once all customers leave the clerks will leave.

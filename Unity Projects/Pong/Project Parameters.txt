This is the first game I built. It is made using the Unity Game Engine and coding with C# on Visual Studios. It is pong but with a few twists to make it more challenging. The game incrementaly speeds up, each round getting harder the longer it goes for. Additionaly there is a blocker that comes into the game in the middle of each round that will deflect the ball back or in different directions, adding twists to the game. There are different enviorments to choose from in settings, each one with different paddles, blockers, backgrounds, balls, and music.
